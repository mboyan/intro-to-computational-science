    "### 2. The SIR Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the SIR model is defined as a Python class, which will contain all the relevant input data for a specific disease, so that the outcomes of different diseases can be easily compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Initialization Function\n",
    "At the initialization of the class, the values of $\\beta$ (infection rate) and $\\gamma$ (recovery rate) which will be used in the further calculations will be derived from \"real-life\" values as described in [1](#references) (p.17-18).\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta = -\\kappa ln(1-C)$, where $\\kappa$ is the number of individual contacts per unit time and $C$ is the probability of infection in the case of an infected contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma = 1/P_i$ where $P_i$ is the period of infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters $k$, $C$ and $P_i$ will be written down in the code as `k`, `c` and `pinf` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the population data will be initialized in the same function. The number of susceptible individuals $X$, infected ones $Y$ and recovered ones $Z$ will be available as optional arguments, which can either be user-defined or follow default values. The sum of the three quantities forms the population size $N$ and all of these values are then used to calculate the proportions of susceptibles $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Differential equations\n",
    "The system of differential equations governing the dynamics of the model will be defined in a special function called `SIR_nd` standing for \"SIR model, no demography\", which iterates over the clas-specific $S$, $I$ and $R$ variables, updates and returns their corresponding derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is created with the purpose to be exchanged in case a different dynamic system is to be used. The current equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dS}{dt}=-\\beta S I\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dI}{dt}= \\beta S I - \\gamma I\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dR}{dt}= \\gamma I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function for the differential equations is stored as a class variable upon initialization."
